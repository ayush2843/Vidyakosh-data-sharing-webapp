                    Choosing and preparing for courses is an extremely daunting task due to the fact that most students have no idea what to expect from a course. Even those who do have some general idea mostly do so due to the advice of a few seniors they are in contact
                    with. But even then, there are quite a few insights that get lost in the ravages of time, and a lot of misinformation that doesnâ€™t.
